## Original images from LEGO parts

This folder should contain images of single LEGO parts in the detection area which will then be used to create template images. There should be one image of every different LEGO part from different sides and for different colors. These will be the classes that will be trained to the detector. The image file names should start with the color code character (for example: g, b, r, y) then the class identifier (for example: 2, 7, 21, 90) and then an underscore _ and the orientation id (a, b, c, d or u). The orientation index u should be used for orientations that can easily be misinterpreted as other LEGO parts.

Example file name: b4_a.png
